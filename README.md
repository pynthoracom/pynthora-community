## ❓ How to Ask Questions

### Using GitHub Issues

2. **Create a new issue** with a clear, descriptive title
3. **Use the question template** (if available) to structure your question
4. **Tag appropriately** with relevant labels (e.g., `question`, `help-wanted`, `beginner`)

### Question Template

When creating a new question, please include:

```markdown

### Best Practices

- ✅ **Be specific**: Provide clear details about your question
- ✅ **Include context**: Explain what you're working on and why
- ✅ **Show effort**: Describe what you've already tried
- ✅ **Be respectful**: Remember that community members are volunteering their time
- ❌ **Don't ask duplicate questions**: Search first!
- ❌ **Don't be vague**: "It doesn't work" isn't helpful

## 📖 FAQ

### How do I mark a question as solved?

Close the issue and add a comment thanking those who helped. You can also add the `solved` label.

### Can I ask multiple questions in one issue?

It's better to create separate issues for different questions. This makes it easier to:

- Track and answer specific questions
- Search for solutions later
- Help others find relevant answers

### What if my question is off-topic?

Check the repository's scope and guidelines. If it's clearly off-topic, we may close it, but we'll try to redirect you to a better place.

### How long should I wait for an answer?

There's no guaranteed response time, but typically:

- Simple questions: A few hours to a day
- Complex questions: A few days
- Very specific/niche questions: May take longer

Be patient, and feel free to provide additional context if needed.
